# Activity Logging Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Data added from the admin page appeared in the website but didn't appear in the dashboard or Recent Activity, even though it was added to the database.

## Root Cause
The `addActivity` function in `src/lib/data.ts` was not returning any indication of success or failure. It only logged errors to the console but didn't provide feedback to the calling code about whether the activity logging succeeded.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/lib/data.ts`
- Modified `addActivity` function to return `Promise<boolean>` instead of `Promise<void>`
- Returns `true` on successful activity insertion
- Returns `false` on error and logs the error to console

### 2. Updated `src/app/admin/actions.ts`
- Modified all action functions to handle the return value from `addActivity`
- Added error handling for activity logging failures
- Added console warnings when activity logging fails
- Main operations continue even if activity logging fails

### Files Updated:
- `src/lib/data.ts` - Fixed `addActivity` function return type
- `src/app/admin/actions.ts` - Updated all action functions to handle activity logging results

## Key Improvements
1. **Error Handling**: Activity logging failures are now properly handled and logged
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Main operations continue even if activity logging fails
3. **Debugging**: Console warnings help identify when activity logging issues occur
4. **Reliability**: The system is more robust against activity logging failures

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the admin dashboard
3. Add a new member, event, blog post, or glossary term
4. Check the browser console for any activity logging warnings
5. Verify that the data appears in both the website and the dashboard/Recent Activity
6. Check that activities are properly logged in the Recent Activity section

## Expected Behavior
- Data should now appear in both the website content and the dashboard/Recent Activity
- Activity logging failures should be visible in the browser console as warnings
- The main operations should complete successfully even if activity logging fails
- The system should be more resilient to database connectivity issues

## Files to Monitor
- Browser console for activity logging warnings
- Database activities table for new entries
- Dashboard and Recent Activity components for proper data display
